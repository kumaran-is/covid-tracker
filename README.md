## Quick Start

1. Clone repository and enter it

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kumaran-is/covid-tracker.git
  cd covid-tracker
  ```

2. Install NPM and Bower dependencies

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Run the application locally. Navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

  ```bash
 ng serve --o
  ```

## Host the Application on AWS S3 using AWS CLI

1. Run below command to create a bucket in S3. This command creates a bucket in  `us-east-1` AWS region. ðŸ‘‰ Make sure to replace `bucket_name` with your own bucket name and `region` with the region that you want to create the bucket in the package.json scripts.
ðŸ‘‰ Note: Bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3. The bucket name should be same as domain or subdomain. Example something like `covid.com` or `dev.covid.com`.

  ```bash
  npm run aws-cb
  ```

2. Run below command to enable S3 for static web hosting. ðŸ‘‰ Make sure to replace `bucket_name` with your own bucket name

  ```bash
  npm run aws-website
  ```

3. To make your hosted Angular app available to the public, all objects in the S3 bucket need to be publicly accessible. Go to your bucket in AWS console and create a bucket policy for you S3 bucket as mentioned below. ðŸ‘‰ Make sure to replace `bucket_name` with your own bucket name

  ```JSON
 {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname.com/*"
        }
    ]
}
  ```

4. Now launch the application from AWS s3 by navigating to <http://<YOUR BUCKET NAME>.s3-website-<REGION NAME>.amazonaws.com>

## Publish Angular Application to Github Pages

`Github Pages` is a Github feature that allows you to deploy any static website or web application or Angular application from your `gh-pages` branch to `Github Pages` for free

Using [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) library, you can easily publish your angular application to `Github Pages`.

1. Install [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) as a devDependency to your project

    ```bash
    npm install angular-cli-ghpages --save-dev
    ```

1. Add below npm script to your `package.json`

    ```bash
    "scripts": {
      ....
      .....
      "prod-build": "ng build --prod --base-href=./",
      "git-publish": "npm run prod-build && npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/covid-tracker --branch=gh-pages"
    }
    ```

1. Publish your application from `gh-pages` branch to `Github Pages`. Branch `gh-pages` is automatically created for you. Command below,
first runs production build, automatically commits and pushes the changes from 'dist' folder to `gh-pages` branch and deploys it to `Github Pages`.
Branch `gh-pages` act as a staging folder for deployment.

    ```bash
    npm run git-publish
    ```

1. Launch your application on browser by navigating to `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`. Example to launch this application click this link <https://kumaran-is.github.io/covid-tracker>

1. For more detail and options, refer the official [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) github.
